## Personal Website

This site was started from a template by [LilyKhan](https://repl.it/@lilykhan) with fixes from [Kakashi](https://repl.it/@apoorvsingal). It is mainly used to display my portfolio and other projects I have assisted and worked on.

## I have used:
+ **HTML5** for markup
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling 
+ Bit of **Jquery** to make header animation effects work
+ Bit of **JavaScript** to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices 
+ **Font Awesome** for Icons 
+ **Unsplash** for Images
